	SHOWPT2
Tornado Digipics Viewer and
PT2->BMP converter
V 1.1
September 1994
================================

The digitized 256 color pictures of TORNADO (versions 1.0 thru 1.0e) are 
stored in files with the pt2 extension in the digipics subdirectory. DI used a
simple, but quite effective compression algorithm to compress these images.

The SHOWPT2 program can be used to view these images from DOS or WINDOWS 
without using TORNADO. It can also be used to generate a BITMAP (*.BMP) 
representation of these pictures.

Usually SHOWPT2 will produce 320x200 pixel images which are exact copies of 
TORNADO's digitized picrtures. But SHOWPT2 can also produce 230x240 pixel BMP 
images (aspect ratio of 4:3), which avoids distortions when you use them as 
"wallpaper" with video modes like 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768.
Another option is "border clipping". Some digitized pictures don't cover the 
whole screen and are bordered by black bars. The "border clipping" option
will remove those black bars.


To install showpt2.exe, copy it to a directory on your harddisk and add this 
directory to the PATH environment variable (or copy showpt2 to your DOS 
directory). 


To execute showpt2, use the following calling syntax

To view a pt2 file:
showpt2 <pt2-filename> 

To convert to a bmp file:
showpt2 <pt2-filename> <bmp-filename>

To convert to a bitmap with a 4:3 aspect ratio:

showpt2 <pt2-filename> <bmp-filename> /ar

To enable "border clipping", use the following syntax:

showpt2 <pt2-filename> <bmp-filename> /bc

You can also combine the two options:

showpt2 <pt2-filename> <bmp-filename> /ar /bc

Examples: 

showpt2 c:\games\tornado\digipics\patriot.pt2

showpt2 c:\games\tornado\digipics\mig29.pt2 c:\win31\wallp.bmp /ar /bc



Included in this package is a batch file (conv_all.bat) that will allow you 
to convert all *.pt2 files automatically. It will create a the directory 
"C:\TMP_PT2" and save all converted BMP pictures to this directory. Make sure
there's enough free diskspace on your "C" drive before running CONV_ALL.BAT
(about 2-3 MB).

The batch file must be run in your TORNADO directory.

You can start CONV_ALL with optional /AR and/or /BC command line options,
e.g.:

..\conv_all /AR /BC  
[aspect ratio correction and border clipping]

or

..\conv_all

[no ar correction, no border clipping].

TORNADO tools:
Tornado Keyboard Mapper: (TKM) A safer and more convenient keybaord layout 
			 for TORNADO: It moves the ejection trigger CTRL-E
			 away from the radar off switch CTRL-R. Other
			 keyboard function modifications optional,
			 special version for german keyboards available

Tornado Logbook Editor:  (TLE) Decode the encrypted logbook files! Use it to
			 -resurrect pilots killed by mistake
			 -free pilots from POW camps :)
			 -rename the infamous GrpCpt deFault
			 -correct the rank of your pilot, if TORNADO
			  refuses to give you a promotion because of a
			  promotion bug in some versions of TORNADO
			 -clone pilots to make backups

Tornado Map Fax Machine: (TMF) Print snapshots of the Mission Planners Screen
			 as a kneepad map without leaving TORNADO.
			 Works with most 24-needle, ink jet and laser

CYAC_2j:                Use a second joystick or a joystick with a throttle
			wheel to control the thrust, instead of the keyboard.
			It also has an optinal programmable fire-button- and
			view-selection-feature. Works with version 1.0
			of CYAC, not yet tested with version 1.1
