TORNADO SB DETECTION PATCH FOR FAST COMPUTERS

Vers 1.0
(c) 1995 Heinz-Bernd Eggenstein

This patch requires TPATCHER.EXE Vers 1.0 or higher

==================================================================

What's this all about?
=========================
Many users of Tornado versions 1.0c - 1.0e have reported problems when 
using a Soundblaster compatible cards. One of the problems is a frequent 
lock-up when firing the cannon (this problem is addressed by *another*
patch, T_CANNON.ZIP. The other problem occurs when running Tornado on 
fast machines: TDO will fail to detect the presence of a Soundblaster
compatible card and will display the error message "System error: 
sound card not detected". This patch is a first attempt to cure this
problem.

THIS PATCH REQUIRES THE PROGRAM TPATCHER.EXE. TPATCHER should be
available from the same source you downloaded this patch from.


This is a first version of a patch to correct the problem. It should 
work with the following versions of Tornado:

European (DI) versions 1.0c, 1.0d, 10.e

American Versions 1.0c, 1.0d

And American Versions 1.0d patched with the European 1.0e patch.

It will not work with the Trimark Interactive 1.0e Edition of Tornado.
        ===    
The reason for this is that in the Trimark release, Soundblaster support 
was intentionally disabled internally.

  

Instructions:

1) copy all the files in the distribution archive of this patch to the main 
Tornado directory. Of course, you have to run TDO from a hard disk because 
otherwise it's difficult to patch files on a CD-ROM :)

2) make backup copies of all *.exe in the FLIGHT subdirectory. Remember, this 
is just a beta test version

3) Run SB_dtct.bat. This calls the T_PATCHER.EXE program that performs the 
patch. The program will look into every file flight\ *.exe for cannon sounds. 
If one is found, you can choose whether to install the original or one of 
three patches. Using this menu, you will be able to undo the patch 
by re-installing the original code fragment.

4) Keep your fingers crossed

5) Run Tornado and select SoundBlaster sound effects in the Preferences 
   Screen.


Good luck!!
