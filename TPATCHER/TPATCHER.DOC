What's this all about?
=========================

TPATCHER.EXE is a generic patching program, that means that it can
perform a variety of patches as instructed by INI-files that come
with the individual patches itself. This eliminates the need to 
include the code that performs the patching itself with each and every
patch.

Instructions:

1) copy all the files in the distribution archive of this patch to the main 
Tornado directory. Of course, you have to run TDO from a hard disk because 
otherwise it's difficult to patch files on a CD-ROM :)

2) Download and unzip any patches you want to perform into the main
   Tornado directory.
   
3) Read the manual file that comes with every patch carefully. 

4) With every patch, there will come a batch file that has to be
   executed. This batch file will call TPATCHER.EXE with the appropriate 
   command line arguments.
