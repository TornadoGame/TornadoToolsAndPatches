1) License terms
================
This software is NOT Shareware, Freeware or Public Domain software. Only 
registered users of Tornado Staff and Command College (TCSC) are allowed to
use it. This patch may not be copied or uploaded to a BBS/online service 
without the consent of its authors. 

2) What is T_RIDE_P
===================
In DI's TORNADO simulation, you can select seven altitudes for terrain 
following mode: 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000 and 1500 ft above ground level
(AGL).

This is not entirely realistic, since REAL IDS Tornados can handle terrain
following at altitudes as low as 100 ft AGL.

This patch tries to correct this, allowing you to choose one of the 
following terrain following "RIDE" altitudes in flight: 

100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 1500 ft AGL.

(note that 750 ft is no longer available).

3) How to install the patch
===========================
Just copy all files in the distribution archive of this patch to the 
main Tornado directory (the one with the FLIGHT and AMP subdirectories).

If you run Tornado from a CD-ROM, you'll have to install TDO on a hard disk
first (it's not so easy to patch files on a CD-ROM <g>).


You also need the generic patching program TPATCHER.EXE which should be 
available from the same source from where you downloaded this patch.


Then, run the batch file T_RIDE_P. That's all.


4) How can I restore the original, unpatched files?
===================================================
Just run the batch file T_RIDE_P.BAT and when prompted, choose to install 
the original tables.


5) Limitations
==============
The mission planner still offers the original RIDE altitude setting (200ft 
... 750, 1000 & 1500 ft), so you should not select 750 ft Ride Altitude in 
the mission planner since this is not supported by the flight module (the
750 ft option had to be deleted to make room for the 100ft option)

At 100 ft TF flight, the B-risk light in the front cockpit (under the 
E-Scope) will be lit permanently (think of it as a reminder of the danger of
running into power lines)

If you have a 'noisy' joystick or your joystick is not calibrated correctly,
sometimes the setting for TF ride altitude may change even if the stick is 
physically centered. This can be dangerous when the TF altitude drops to 
100 ft without the pilot being aware of this (note that power lines are a 
danger at this altitude!!). If you experience this problem, first try to 
re-calibrate the joystick, and don't use the hi-sensitivity option for the 
joystick while in TF mode. If you want to be absolutely sure this is not 
happening, you can switch temporarily to keyboard control (with the "7" key 
on the main keyboard (check the "knee view" [NUM-LOCK])). 


6) Warning:
===========
===========

Terrain following at only 100 ft (about 30 meters) takes exceptional 
care, it's far more dangerous than riding at 200 ft. The terrain following 
mechanism's ability to avoid obstacles is limited by constraints imposed
by the performance limits of the Tornado. If you are riding very fast 
with wings swept back at 100 ft AGL, your Tornado may crash into a steep 
hill even in TF mode because in this configuration, the Tornado can not
pull enough Gs to jump over the obstacle even if the obstacle is 
detected by the TF mechanism. The same can happen even on 200 ft rides, but
less often. 

Sometimes, your Tornado will pull up hard, disengage the autopilot and sound
an alarm. This is not a bug but an emergency fail safe procedure commanded
by the TF system if it detects that the TF system can no longer cope with the 
terrain ahead of the Tornado. 

You should also note that the TF autopilot takes only "natural terrain" into 
consideration, not tall buildings or power lines!!!!!


Also, note that it's not safe to drop most free fall munitions at only
100 ft AGL. In most cases, your Tornado will be damaged by the explosion if
you are only 100 ft above ground level!
