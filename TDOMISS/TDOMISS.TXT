This is the first revision of a program to extract a mission summary
from Tornado's .mis and .dta files, listing mission objectives and
waypoints.

Copy it to a directory in your path and e.g.

	tdomiss miss1 >miss1.txt

or

	tdomiss \games\tornado\amp\map5\miss1

will extract the info for mission 1, to the screen or to disk as required.

Any comments and suggestions gratefully received, particularly any info
on the contents of .dta and .mis files so I can improve the output.

tdomiss has been tested on the missions supplied with 1.0e Europe.
