Unpacking instructions for DSPEED.ZIP

To unpack this archive, you need the password that you got in response to 
your TCSC registration. Unpack all the files into the main TORNADO directory.

Use the command 


DSPEED -sPASSWORD 


where PASSWORD is replaced by the TCSC registration password.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE: Unlike earlier TCSC add-ons, the password command line option 
is -sPASSWORD , no longer -gPASSWORD !! If you have problems unpacking the 
self-extracting file, check that the you are using the correct password, and 
not (say) -sgPASSWORD
