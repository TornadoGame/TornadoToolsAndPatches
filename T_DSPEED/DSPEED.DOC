======================================================================



1) License terms
================
This software is NOT Shareware, Freeware or Public Domain software. Only 
registered users of Tornado Staff and Command College (TCSC) are allowed to
use it. This patch may not be copied or uploaded to a BBS/online service 
without the consent of its authors. 


2) What is this?
================
By default, the speed for a turning waypoint in TORNADO is set to 420 kts.
Many TORNADO users use higher speeds, at least for the IDS Tornados. The 
reason is that a flightplan with a higher, but more constand speed is more
fuel efficient, because there's less need to use reheat. Currently, it's 
tedious to change the speed for every navigation waypoint. With this patch,
you can set the default speed to either 500kts, 520 kts (my favourite 
setting) or even 550 kts. 

Note that 520 kts or 550 kts is probably too fast for the ADV 
Tornados if they fly at 10,000 ft or above (the same Indicated Airspeed 
means higher True Airspeed at higher altitudes.). So you might want to 
manually decrease the ADV's speed after applying the patch. However, since 
there are almost always more than three times as many IDS waypoints than 
ADV waypoints in a full 8 plane flightplan, the patch will nevertheless
decrease the workload for mission planning.

3) Limitations
==============
This patch will affect pre-canned flightplans for TORNADO's single missions
and level 1-/2-campaigns. Most likely, the flightplans will be out of sync
or will even produce red "problem" windows. For the pre-canned misisons, it's
best to use the original 420 kts default value. The increased default value 
is intended for Command Campaigns where the user has to edit many waypoints.



4) How to install the patch
===========================
Just copy all files in the distribution archive of this patch to the 
main Tornado directory (the one with the FLIGHT and AMP subdirectories).

If you run Tornado from a CD-ROM, you'll have to install TDO on a hard disk
first (it's not so easy to patch files on a CD-ROM <g>).


You also need the generic patching program TPATCHER.EXE which should be 
available from the same source from where you downloaded this patch.


Then, run the batch file DSPEED.bat. That's all.


5) How can I restore the original, unpatched files?
===================================================
Just run the batch file DSPEED.BAT and when prompted, choose to install 
the original code.
