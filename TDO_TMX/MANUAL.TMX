 ABSTRACT

TMX is a simple but powerful tool to allow TORNADO (IBM version) users
to exchange missions created with the Mission Planner. For example you
can fly missions uploaded by TCSC 'staff' or design your own missions
for others to fly. This puts you in the position of either a pilot who
receives orders he/she has no influence on or that of a commander who 
can give orders but doesn't have to carry them out him/herself.

You can also use TMX to store missions you've flown so that you can 
repeat them later, e.g. after discussing tactics with other TDO pilots.


Throughout the manual, we assume that you have version 1.0c,10.d or 1.0e
of TORNADO. If you have Version 1.0b or below, you should first update
to Version 1.0c by executing a free update patch available from DI or
various FTP servers, e.g.

cactus.org   /pub/hitech-sim/patches/tornado (US versions of Tornado)
belarius.robots.ox.ac.uk /FTP/hitech-sim/patches (Euro patches)



0) Definition of Terms
----------------------
Throughout this manual, we will use the term MISSION to characterize a
fixed initial situation in the virtual battlefield of TORNADO. This 
situation consists of the following factors:

-space      : Warzone and starting position of the players plane
-time       : mission start time
-weather    : visibility (fog), cloud layer, wind 
-flightplans: the set of waypoints programmed into the AFD
	      Wingmen and enemies also have flightplans
-payload    : the ordnance you are carrying
-scenery    : not necessarily the initial scenery, some structures may be
	      destroyed. 
-ground situation: this includes the deployment of vehicles and the 
	      occupation status (blue/orange) of the areas on the map. 
	      

The term MISSION RESULTS stands for the difference between the initial
mission situation and the situation at the end of the mission , e.g.

-damage to the Tornado
-destroyed targets
-time spent to execute the mission
-position of the Tornado at the end of the mission

1) Installation
---------------
Copy all files in the distribution package to the main Tornado 
directory (the directory with the AMP, FIGHT, LOG etc subdirectories).


If you have Tornado Version 1.0c or lower, and you want to design
mission yourself for others to play, you first have to execute a
patch (not needed for versions 1.0d and 1.0e of Tornado). Just execute
the batch file T_TMX_P.BAT. This patch may fail with some US-versions
of Tornado. If it fails, you will still be able to export mission, but
the process to do so will be slightly more inconvenient.

If you later want to reverse the patch, execute T_TMX_RP.BAT


Before using TMX to import missions, you have to execute an auto-
configuration run. The purpose of this is to tell TMX what kind of
sound card, joystick etc you are using. 

AUTO-CONFIGURATION:

First you have to make sure that all settings in the preferences screen
of TORNADO are correct. Those settings will be used by TMX when
importing missions designed by others.

Then leave the preferences screen and fly ANY TORNADO mission, e.g. some
Simulator Single Mission. You don't have to fly the mission to the end, 
just press CTRL-Q after you enter the cockpit. This will take you to the 
debrief screen. 

If you have 
  -version 1.0d or 1.0e: Press CTRL-Q to leave TORNADO
  -version 1.0c and the TMX patch succeeded: PRESS CTRL-Q
  -version 1.0c but the TMX patch failed: REBOOT your computer.
  
There should be a file gameplay.in (among other files) in the 
DATAXCHG subdirectory.

Now run TMX with the -c command line option:

    TMX -c
    
    

TMX will now create a file TMX.INI that contains your Tornado
configuration data (joystick calibration, sound card config...).



2) How to use TMX
------------------
There are two ways to use TMX. The first is a simple menu-driven, 
interactive interface, the second is command line option oriented
(resembling the way you use programs like ARJ or PKZIP). In the
following text, only the command line interface is discussed, the menu
driven interface should then be self-explaining.

2.1) Import a mission
---------------------
TMX missions are stored in files which usually have the TMX file 
extension. One example mission is included in this package, others 
you will be able to downloaded in lib. 8 of FSFORUM on CompuServe or 
various FTP servers on the Internet.

In most cases you will get files in compressed form (e.g. files *.zip
compressed with PKZIP), so you will first have to uncompress those
files. The example TMX mission that comes with this package is contained
in the file EXAMPLE.ZIP, which contains the TMX mission file and briefing 
text files and maps.

The *.TMX file must be copied to the same directory where TMX.EXE is
stored.

Now execute TMX with the -im (import mission) command line option and
the filename as the second argument, e.g.:

  TMX -im  EXAMPLE.TMX
  
TMX will now decode the *.TMX file and if it can decode the data
successfully, it will write a file TMX_FLY.BAT to the Tornado main
directory. If you are ready to fly the imported mission, execute this
batch file.

(Usually, some text and graphic files will come with the *.TMX file to
brief the pilot for the mission. Make sure to read/print this first so
that you know what the mission is all about. Depending on the way the mission 
was created, a file BRIEFING can be created while importing the mission. If 
present, the file will usually contain briefing information.)

========================================================================
NOTE: IF you are using the NVG-patch that comes with TMF 1.03, make sure
you load the TSG.EXE TSR program included in TMF 1.03 before executing 
TMX_FLY.BAT.
========================================================================

To import a mission taking place in the Operation Desert Storm Warzone,
you have to own version 1.0d or higher of TORNADO.

After completing the mission and pressing CTRL-Q to leave the cockpit,
you return to the DOS prompt. Some missions may come with a tool to 
do a debriefing. Other missions may not come with a debriefing tool, e.g.
missions that are part of a competition. This is intended to make cheating 
as difficult as possible. If pilots knew exactly what they have hit, they 
could refly the mission until getting optimal results. 

When flying missions uploaded by TCSC Associates as part of a contest, 
you will be able to use the EXPORT RESULTS feature of TMX to send your 
mission results to TCSC Associates for evaluation. (But read the data 
security note at the end of this manual)

Later on TCSC Associates might release a general DEBRIEFING tool for those 
who want to be referees in competitions.

2.2) Exporting Results
----------------------
To export your mission results, you can use TMX to write the results to
a new file (e.g. results.TMX). You can write some comments into a file 
DEBRIEF. If this file is present, it will be incorporated into the mission 
result file.

To export the results, execute TMX with the -xr (export results) command 
line option:

   TMX -xr results.tmx
      

2.3) Exporting Missions
-----------------------
You can export any mission that you can fly yourself, e.g.

-Any of the pre-canned Single Missions
-A "FREE FIRE" Single Mission that lets you plan your flight from
 scratch
-Any mission generated during a Level-1, Level-2 or Command Campaign


After planning the mission, enter the cockpit. You don't have to fly the
mission you want to export to the end, just press CTRL-Q to leave the
cockpit. You will then return to the DEBRIEF screen.

If you have 
  -version 1.0d or 1.0e: Press CTRL-Q to leave TORNADO.
  -version 1.0c and the TMX patch succeeded: PRESS QTRL-Q
  -version 1.0c but the TMX patch failed: REBOOT your computer.
     
    
At the DOS-prompt, go to the TORNADO main directory and execute 
TMX with the -xm (export mission) command line option and a filename as
second argument, e.g.

   TMX -xm my_msn.tmx

TMX will now save the mission to the file my_msn.tmx . If there is a file
BRIEFING.OUT in the current directory, the file will be included into the
mission file. When the recipient of the mission unpacks it using TMX, this 
file will be created as BRIEFING in his/her current directory.


2.4) Importing Results
----------------------
This feature is only useful for referees in competitions.

3) Hints for creating missions
------------------------------
During beta-testing of this tool, it turned out that designing and flying
TMX missions is as much fun as making up a nice story that you can use to
brief other pilots. When you send a mission to some TDO pilot(s), don't just 
tell them to bomb the targets under waypoints X and Y. Use your imagination 
to invent a story that explains the situation. Why are those targets 
important? Who are the enemies? .... You should also make sure the mission 
is not too easy. Using the mission planner, make sure there are a few SAMs 
along the flight path :-). 

If you have TMF, or any screen-grabbing program like PCXDUMP or 
SCREENTHIEF, make sure the pilot gets a map of the region, but you may want 
to hide a few layers of information e.g. the enemy CAP positions and SAM/AAA
positions. 


If you base your mission on a FREE FIRE mission, you can plan the mission 
from scratch, you can even choose the time at which the mission starts: click 
on the "UP" key of the waypoint A time button. 

Using a simulator mission, you can also edit the weather. But when you use 
the Simulator Missions, make sure to adjust the 'realism' buttons (limited 
weapons, limited fuel etc) because those settings will influence the way
that mission is later executed after someone imports it with TMX.

===========================================================================
		      A note concerning data security
===========================================================================

The TMX program's "export results" feature will make it possible for TMX 
users to send mission results to competition referees.

However, as a general rule of thumb, you should NEVER EVER send a file 
generated by some shareware program to anybody you don't trust. The reason 
is that the program may spy on your system and send back some data you
want to keep private (e.g. the program may try to steal your CIS password).

TMX does NOT spy. That is, the original version of TMX does not spy. It only
encodes the files *.out generated by Tornado. But if you downloaded TMX from
an FTP site (in contrast to the more tightly guarded CompuServe Forum   
libraries), you really can never be sure who uploaded it. So, if in doubt, 
don't send any files created by a program you don't trust to people you 
don't trust. NEVER!

The source code of TMX is available for everybody who wants to verify it 
does nothing illegal, under the condition that the source code is not used 
for commercial purposes.
